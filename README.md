* WordLit is a fast-paced game that challenges players' word-solving skills.

* The game features a unique word list generated partially by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and me (the creator)  consisting of around 2,000 definable English words with definitions.

* In each round, the game randomly selects 5 words from the list and places them into an array, finds 2 words with a common letter and places them on a 5x5 grid, with the 2 words intersecting at a common letter.

* The keyboard below the grid includes all the letters required to form the 2 words, along with additional random letters.

* The player has 12 guesses to correctly identify the 2 words before the game ends and moves onto the next round.

* Authenticated user high scores are stored on a Node.js server and displayed on the leaderboard for all players to see, creating a competitive and engaging atmosphere.
